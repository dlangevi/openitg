OpenITG - an open-source rhythm dancing game which is a fork of StepMania 3.95
with the goal of adding arcade-like ITG-style behavior and serving as a drop-in
replacement for the ITG binary on arcade cabinents.

See original project to contribute if you want, this is my personal abomination

Not currently bothering with packaging assests, this is just to generate the
openitg binary.

Using the assest gotten when downloading zip home version and coping binary
over.

To configure (for fresh build)
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-x --with-gnu-ld
$ make clean

To build just
$ make
$ strip --strip-unneeded src/openitg
$ cp src/openitg $OPENITG/openitg
